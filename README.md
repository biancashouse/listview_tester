Demonstrate a Flutter issue with ListView widget testing

This tiny flutter sample has been created for the flutter team to address the following issue:

This simple app is a ListView of 10 Cards, each containing a ListTile of Text.
The listview test sample fails: only finds 9 out of the 10 items.
If you remove the ListTile from the tree and just have each item in a Card, it passes: finds all 10 items.

Bug ?
Workaround ?
Expanation ?

Feedback much appreciated, thanks.
